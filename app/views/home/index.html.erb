    <h1>A FASHION LINK BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA</h1>
    <p>LCM's main mission is to serve as a "fashion link" between some Asian fashion players and European brands or manufacturers.</p><br>
    <p>Since our creation in 2000, we have provided our customers with in-depth knowledge of the Fashion industry, its marketing and more recently its developments in the digital fashion sector.
    Thanks to our long and deep experience within this industry in Europe and Asia, LCM can accompany its customers in the constant evolution, the changes and the needs of fashion.</p><br>
    <p>Our objective is to facilitate, for our customers, the connections, business flow and communications between Europe and Asia. To do this, our customers can count on a unique Franco-Japanese organization based in Paris, on a significant database of European suppliers as well as on a large network within the fashion industry in Europe and Asia.</p><br>
<p>Since 2008, LCM has focused its activities primarily on the Japanese market by establishing and strengthening its collaborations with major Japanese companies such as Shosha, fashion distributors, department stores and major retailers.</p>
