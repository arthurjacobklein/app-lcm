## Digitalization of an e-commerce platform
La Connexion Mode, a company specialising in the export of European ready-to-wear products to Japanese department stores and concept stores for over 20 years, is in need of renovation in the way it does business.

The idea would be to gradually digitalize their services, starting with a platform that would allow small Parisian brands (clothing, accessories, lifestyle) to have visibility in Japan by offering these brands to LCM customers.

Then LCM takes care of all the administrative and logistical aspects of these purchases, from the supplier (the brand) to the Japanese store (the customer).
